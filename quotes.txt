The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
You have within you right now, everything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.
Don’t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.
I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.
Opportunities don't happen. You create them.
Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.
You learn more from failure than from success. Don’t let it stop you. Failure builds character.
It’s not whether you get knocked down, it’s whether you get up.
If you are working on something that you really care about, you don’t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.
People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Wishing is not enough; we must do.
Imagine your life is perfect in every respect; what would it look like?
